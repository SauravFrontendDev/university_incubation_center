          <p>
            Startup India is a flagship initiative of the Government of India,
            intended to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and
            Startups in the country that will drive sustainable economic growth
            and generate large scale employment opportunities. The Government
            through this initiative aims to empower Startups to grow through
            innovation and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Startups in India need to be recognized by the Department of
            Industrial Policy and Promotion (“DIPP”) to avail the benefits under
            the Action Plan. The applications for such a recognition have to be
            accompanied by a letter of
            recommendation/support/funding/endorsement from an Incubator.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per Uttar Pradesh Start UP Policy, 2020 “Incubators are the most
            critical component of startup ecosystem. They are established by
            private/government host institutes to support startup companies
            during their early stages of life to develop a scalable business
            model. They provide startups with various resources such as physical
            office space, coaching, mentoring, legal & corporate services and
            providing network connections to grow their business. An incubator
            shall also mean a Technology Business Incubator recognized by
            Government of India. In the context of this policy, incubators will
            serve as first point of contact for startups to get their business
            plans evaluated for availing any incentives as per the Startup
            Policy. Startups shall be able to apply for financial incentives to
            Nodal Agency only after approval by the incubators.”
